# A Little Survey

Here are just a few questions so I can get to know you and so you can get practice submitting an assignment in Canvas.  For each question, insert your answer underneath. Make sure each answer is at the minimum a complete sentence with correctly spelled words and correct puncuation. 

## A short history of you.  
Where did you attend High School, and did you graduate? Compare english class to math, is one easier for you than the other? Finally which subject did you do the best in? Your answer should have at least two sentences devoted to each question.  
  
### my answer     
I went to Roybal Learning Center for High School which is located in Downtown LA. I graduated in 2021 right after Covid.I think for me English class is the most easiest class to me than math because I had always struggle in math class however I try my best to push it to my limit because trying is what matters.The best subject I done would be Science because it always been the easiest to learn about and the class I less struggled because I am good at memorizing information and since im a visual learned there's always a demostration right after the lesson.  

     


## Your computer and your and its capability?  
 For this class  you need a computer you can use at home.  So, what kind is it (windows, Apple, Linux)?  On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is a total dummy (doesn't know a mouse from a keyboard) and 10 is a complete geek (knows computer stuff in and out) How do you rate yourself?  You also need to have have internet access. How is your connection to the internet where you live?

### my answer   
 I owned an Apple computer and since im very comfortable with it I would say my knowledge of doing computer things would be a 9 depending of what we are doing.I definitely have access to internet access anywhere since with apple everything is connected I can always share my connection with the item and the connection itself is good where I live. 
   

## Others and You?   
What name do you prefer to be called by your classmates and instructor, if your buddys call you something but you want people in the class to call you something else - what would that be? 

### my answer     
  
   I don't have any preference towards my name so going by just Kelly is completely fine.

 




## Aspirations?   
What do you want to achieve in life?  What college subject do you think would be of the greatest interest to you? What degree or certificate are you trying to achieve?
